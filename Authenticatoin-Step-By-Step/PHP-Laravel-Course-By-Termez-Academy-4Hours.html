## Setup new laravel project -- I'll create a new project to practice all of course here
    ..composer global require laravel/installer \\ this will be create the laravel global
        [1] >> laravel new example-app
        [2] >> cd example-app
        [3] >> npm install && npm run build
        [4] >> composer run dev >> to run [[vite && server]] this into composer.json in "dev" to run this command for both
        [6] >> after write the database connection in file .env -- we need to run this command to migrate all database and not get any error 
            [7] >> php a rtisan migrate
            .. and also connect with SqlTools in vscode to see all of them this step is option

        .. {{In summary}}, controllers handle the logic for processing requests, interacting with the database through models, and
    returning the correct response to the client.


    [..] >> Here's a brief overview of how HTTP requests are handled in Laravel:
            1\ Request: A user sends a request to the application, like accessing a page.
            
            2\ Route: The request is matched to a route defined in your application.
            
            3\ Middleware: Before reaching the controller, the request passes through middleware. Middleware can perform tasks like
            authentication, logging, or modifying the request.
            
            4\ Controller: If the middleware allows the request to proceed, it's handled by the controller. The controller contains the
            main logic to process the request and generate a response.
            
            5\ Response: The controller returns a response, which is then sent back

                >> This ensures that every request to /users goes through the CheckIfAuthenticated middleware first.

    [..] >> [[ About API ]] >>>>> (((

                    GitHub Copilot
                    Yes, that's correct. The routes defined in api.php are intended for external clients to interact with your server-side
                    application. These routes are part of your server-side application, but they are specifically designed to be accessed by
                    external clients over the network.

                        .. By using the api.php file, you can effectively manage and organize the API endpoints of your Laravel application.

                        [[Notice::]] when define any routes in api file and then write the route in browser we need need to write 
                            -- http://localhost:8000/api/your-route
                            -- http://localhost:8000/api/v1/your-route
                            without write the 'api' in the url we will not get the response of the route and get '404' error 

                            Example >> Route::middleware('auth:sanctum')->get('/user', function (Request $request) {
                            return $request->user();
                            }); >> and to get this route 'user' we will write

Notice >> to use a postman tool with mysql oracle we need to do some of steps to connect with the database to dealing with the database like to do [post request, Delete request, and other] -- because with disconnect we will not get any response when do sql post or delete statements
                    

                
            .. Postman is primarily used for testing and interacting with external APIs. It allows you to send HTTP requests to your
            API endpoints and inspect the responses, which is especially useful when developing and debugging APIs that external
            clients (such as web or mobile applications)

                    [..] >> {{When to Use api.php}}
                        External APIs: If you are building an API that will be consumed by external clients (such as mobile apps or third-party
                        services), it is a good practice to define these routes in api.php.
                        Stateless Routes: API routes are typically stateless, meaning they do not maintain session state. The api.php file is
                        designed for such routes.
                        Middleware: The api middleware group is automatically applied to routes in api.php, which includes features like rate
                        limiting. This makes it easier to manage and secure your API routes.

            Feature:: Database Migrations -- Database CLI (Manual)
            .Version Control:: Tracks schema changes over time -- No version control; manual scripts required.
            .Collaboration:: Easy to share with team members via codebase -- Requires exporting and importing .sql files.
            .Rollback Support:: Yes, you can roll back specific migrations or all migrations Requires manual scripting for undoing changes.
            .Automation:: Fully automatable (e.g., php artisan migrate)-- Manual execution of SQL queries.
            .Ease of Use:: High, especially for schema changes during development -- Medium; requires knowledge of SQL commands.
